Description: Electronic medical records (EMR) linked with biorepositories are 
    useful sources for research such as Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS).
    However, accurate disease phenotype information is not readily available in the 
    EMR database. The standard PheWAS method classifies phenotype status by thresholding 
    PheWAS codes defined by grouped ICD-9 codes. This approach has several 
    limitations including inaccuracies in ICD-9 codes and variability in 
    thresholds across diseases, which hampers the power of PheWAS. 
    To improve the power of PheWAS, we propose to do phenotyping by combining 
    information from ICD-9 codes and mentions of the phenotype in clinical 
    notes extracted via natural language processing (NLP) to produce a 
    predicted probability of having the phenotype for each patient.
    We also aim to employ a data-driven approach to select the optimal threshold 
    for classifying disease status. Specifically, we jointly analyze ICD-9 and NLP counts 
    by fitting mixture models adjusted for healthcare utilization to 
    derive predicted probabilities of positive phenotype for each patient 
    (Please see [ref] For more details). This package allows to perform the 
    Multimodal Automated Phenotyping alrogithm.
